The goal of {dataedu} is to provide readers of [Data Science in
Education Using
R](https://github.com/data-edu/data-science-in-education) with a package
with useful functions, data, and references from the book.

## Installation

### 1\. Install {devtools}

First, let’s install {remotes} if you do not have it installed already.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

If you already have {remotes} installed, you can move on to the next
step.

If you are not sure whether you have it installed, you can run this
function, which will install the newest version of {remotes} if you do
not already have it.

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
  library(remotes)
}
```

### 2\. Install {dataedu}

You can install the development version of {dataedu} by running this in
your RStudio console:

``` r
remotes::install_github("data-edu/dataedu")
```

#### Important Notes on Installation

  - {dataedu} requires R 3.6 or above to be installed.

  - {dataedu} has other packages that it needs to be able to run. You
    can see the full list under “Imports” (imported when downloading the
    package) and “Suggests” (we think you should include these too\!) in
    the [DESCRIPTION
    file](https://github.com/data-edu/dataedu/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L34).

  - **We recommend first checking to see if your packages are all
    up-to-date if you are running into issues with installation.** If
    you have installed the imported/suggested packages previously and
    have not updated them in a while, RStudio may prompt you to update
    them. You can choose to (1) ignore this prompt, (2) exit the prompt
    and update your packages, or (3) try to update your packages through
    the prompt. It’s usually easier to exit and update your packages
    outside the prompt (one way to do this is to go to the RStudio
    Packages pane and click Update, then select the packages you’d like
    to update).

### 3\. Call the Package

Before you can use the package, make sure to call it using `library()`:

``` r
library(dataedu)
```

## Package Contents

We created this package to provide our readers an opportunity to jump
into R however they see fit.

1.  [Mass installation of all the packages used in the
    book](#mass-installation-of-packages)
2.  [Reproducible code for the
    walkthroughs](#reproducible-code-for-walkthroughs)
3.  [Access to the data used in each of the
    walkthroughs](#accessing-the-walkthrough-data)
4.  [The dataedu theme and color palette for
    reuse](#using-the-dataedu-theme-and-palette)

### Mass Installation of Packages

We strived to use packages that we use in our daily work when creating
the walkthroughs in the book. Because we covered a variety of subjects,
that means we used a lot of packages\! As described in the Foundational
Skills chapter, you can install the packages individually as they suit
your needs.

However, if you want to get started quickly and download all the
packages at once, please use `install_dataedu()`.

``` r
dataedu::install_dataedu()
```

To see the packages used in the book, run:

``` r
dataedu::dataedu_packages
#>  [1] "apaTables"   "caret"       "dummies"     "ggraph"      "here"       
#>  [6] "janitor"     "lme4"        "lubridate"   "performance" "readxl"     
#> [11] "rtweet"      "randomNames" "sjPlot"      "textdata"    "tidygraph"  
#> [16] "tidylog"     "tidyverse"   "tidytext"
```

**A special note on {tabulizer}:** One of the walkthroughs uses
[tabulizer](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer), created by ROpenSci
to read PDFs. {tabulizer} requires the installation of
[RJava](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html), which
can be a tricky process. {tabulizer} is not included in
`install_dataedu()` and we recommend reading through the notes on its
Github repo if installing.

### Reproducible Code for Walkthroughs

Coming soon\!

### Accessing the Walkthrough Data

To get the data, run `dataedu::` then the dataset as it is named in the
book:

``` r
dataedu::course_data
```

To see all the datasets available in the package, run `data(package =
"dataedu")`.

``` r
# this is to print the results for the README
# only `data(package = "dataedu")` is needed to see this list
a <- data(package = "dataedu")
a$result[ , 3:4]
#>       Item

```

If you would like to download the data in non-`.Rds` (RData) format, the
CSV and JSON formats are available under
[`inst/extdata`](https://github.com/data-edu/dataedu/tree/master/inst/extdata).
Please note that `all_files` is not included because of how large the
file would be.

### Using the {dataedu} Theme and Palette

Add the theme and palette to ggplot2-based plots using `theme_dataedu()`
and `scale_*_dataedu()`.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(dataedu)

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = area, y = popdensity, color = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_dataedu() +
  scale_color_dataedu()
```
